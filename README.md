Here, I've created models which predict whether a given sentence contains some hate or offensive overtone. The logistic regression classifier has done well in both the cases and<br>
we get an accuracy of around 94% in both the cases of hate and offensive content detection.<br>
The models are pickled and available in this repository. However, the other methods I have used here include: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN and Random Forest.
